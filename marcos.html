								<h2>Ferdinan E. Marcos</h2>

							<p><strong>Ferdinand Edralin Marcos</strong>, most commonly known as Ferdinand Marcos was a Philippine lawyer and politician, who as head of state from 1966 to 1986, initiated an autocratic administration in the Philippines that garnered loads of opprobrium for payola and for its repression of egalitarian procedures. </p>
						<br> <strong>Youth and Family</strong>
							<img src="images/pic08.jpg">
							<p>On September 11, 1917, Ferdinand Edralin Marcos was born in Sarrat - a village in the Northern Ilocos region of the island of Luzon in the Philippines. His parents, both teachers from notable families were Josefa Edralin and Mariano Marcos. Marcos was exposed to the political atmosphere at a young age when his father, Mariano Marcos decided to become a congressman in 1925. Not only did Mariano and Josefa coerce Ferdinand to excel in his studies at school, they also wanted him to be preeminent in activities such as wrestling, boxing, hunting, survival skills and marksmanship.</p>
						 <p>Although a substantial influence on Marcos’s life, Mariano was not his biological father. His actual father was a wealthy Chinese man named Ferdinand Chua whom he claims as his “godfather”. Chua was a man of numerous connections. He paid for the young Marcos’s schooling and later on managed to sway the Philippine Supreme Court to rescind the latter’s conviction for murder.</p>
						 <p> Julio Nalundasan was in his own abode, celebrating his congressional election triumph over Mariano Marcos when he was injured and later on died with a .22-caliber bullet filed by eighteen-year-old Ferdinand Marcos. Subsequently, he was imprisoned three years later for Nalundasan’s assassination. After graduating a year later, he was found guilty of the crime. He spent six months in jail, composing his own supplication for a new trial. In 1940, the supreme Court eventually took up Marcos’s plea. The judge (seemingly influenced by Judge Chua) threw out the case. The day after that, Marcos went back to the Supreme Court and took the oath to become a lawyer. </p>
							<br> <strong>Education</strong>
				<img src="images/pic09.jpg">
							<p>
Ferdinand Marcos was educated in Manila, acquired his high school diploma at the age of 15 years old in UP High School batch 1933. He was distinguished as “Ferdi” by his fellow classmates and was remembered “for having a simple demeanor, interested in debates and discussions in which he outshone all.” </p>
							<p> Marcos was also undeniably smart that he was able to top the 1939 Bar Examinations with near-perfect score regardless  of the fact that he was imprisoned for shooting and killing Julio Nalundasan - a political rival of his father. Additionally, he was accused of cheating because of how he was able to ace the exam in an unimaginable feat.
Several people attested his incredible memory, including the late Senator Miriam Santiago. <p>
							<br> <strong>Marriage</strong>
							<img src="images/pic11.jpg">
							<p> When Marcos first met Imelda Romualdez in 1954, it was love at first sight. So after two weeks of romance, the pair decided to tie the knot first in a civil wedding in Baguio City which was followed by a church wedding at the Pro Cathedral of San Miguel in Manila.</p>

<p>For this to be possible, Imelda had to convince Marcos to convert from his original Aglipayan religion to Roman Catholicism. She triumphed in convincing the latter and the church wedding was held afterwards with President Ramon Magsaysay as their principal sponsor. 
							</p>
							<br> <strong>Political Career</strong>
							<p> In December 1948 a magazine editor publicized four articles on the war experiences of Marcos which resulted to the skyrocket of his reputation. A year later, Marcos ran as a Liberal Party candidate for a seat in the Philippine House of Representatives, promising to get veterans’ benefits for approximately two million Filipinos. He won with 70 percent of the Filipinos voting for him. Less than a year later, he was worth a million dollars, mostly because of his American tobacco endownment, a huge cigarette smuggling operation, and his practice of coercing Chinese companies to liaise with him. In 1954, he formally met Imelda Romualdez and married her.</p>
							<p>
Marcos was reelected twice, and in 1959, he was elected to the Philippine Senate. He managed Diosdado Macapagal when the latter decided to run for the Philippine Presidency. He was also the Liberal Party’s vice-president from 1954 to 1961. As per their agreement, Macapagal was supposed to step down after one term to let Marcos run for the presidency. However Macapagal did not do this, urging Marcos to join the opposition Nationalist Party and became their candidate in the 1965 election against Macapagal in which he easily won.
							</p>
							<p>Marcos became the first Philippine president to have won in 1969. Not all Filipinos, however were pleased with his presidency, and after a month following his reelection comprised the most brutal communal demonstrations in the history of the country. Three years later, after growing student protests and a collapsing economy, Marcos declared Martial Law. His excuse was the growing revolutionary movement of the Communist New People's Army, which opposed his government.</p>
							<p> During the next nine years of Martial Law, Marcos tripled the armed forces. When the martial was lifted in 1981, he kept all the power he had been granted under martial law to himself. While the economy continued to fall apart, he and his wife became one of the most influential couples in the world.</p>
