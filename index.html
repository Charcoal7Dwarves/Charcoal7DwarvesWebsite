							<p><strong>Ferdinand Edralin Marcos</strong>, most commonly known as Ferdinand Marcos was a Philippine lawyer and politician, who as head of state from 1966 to 1986, initiated an autocratic administration in the Philippines that garnered loads of opprobrium for payola and for its repression of egalitarian procedures. </p>
							<p>On September 11, 1917, Ferdinand Edralin Marcos was born in Sarrat - a village in the Northern Ilocos region of the island of Luzon in the Philippines. His parents, both teachers from notable families were Josefa Edralin and Mariano Marcos. Marcos was exposed to the political atmosphere at a young age when his father, Mariano Marcos decided to become a congressman in 1925. Not only did Mariano and Josefa coerce Ferdinand to excel in his studies at school, they also wanted him to be preeminent in activities such as wrestling, boxing, hunting, survival skills and marksmanship.</p>
